# Internship Task 1: SQL JOIN Operations

This project is part of my internship, focusing on practicing and demonstrating SQL JOIN operations using MySQL Workbench.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `join_queries.sql` â€“ SQL file with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN (simulated using UNION).
- `screenshots/` â€“ Contains result screenshots for each JOIN query.
- `README.md` â€“ This file, with details about the task and content.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to use different types of SQL JOINs to combine relational data
- How to simulate a FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL using UNION
- Executing queries and viewing results in MySQL Workbench

## ðŸ“Š JOIN Queries Used

- `INNER JOIN` â€“ shows only matched records between `students` and `courses`
- `LEFT JOIN` â€“ shows all students, and their course if available
- `RIGHT JOIN` â€“ shows all courses, and the students enrolled if any
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` â€“ simulated by combining LEFT and RIGHT joins with `UNION`

## ðŸ§¾ Sample Query

```sql
SELECT 
    students.student_name,
    courses.course_name
FROM 
    students
INNER JOIN 
    courses
ON 
    students.course_id = courses.course_id;
